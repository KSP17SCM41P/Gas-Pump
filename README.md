# Gas-Pump
The goal of the project is to design two Gas Pump components using the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and then implement these Gas Pump components based on this design using the OO programming language. In this project I have implemented the following OO design patterns: State pattern, Strategy pattern and Abstract Factory pattern. Upon Activate() the data is stored in respective database based on the parameters .The execution commences after the START state where the mode of payment is selected , the type of gas is selected based on the menu displayed .Once the selection is done Gas Pump is started and desired amount of gas is pumped out if payment is successful. The user has been provided with two choices upon stopping of the pump whether to print the receipt or not.
